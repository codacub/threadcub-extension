# 🎯 QUICK START - ThreadCub Extension FIXED

## What I Did:

✅ **Merged old working UI with new download functionality**

### Files Changed:
1. **popup/** - Reverted to old simple UI (no broken auth)
2. **side-panel.js** - Reverted to use `note` instead of `notes`
3. **content.js** - KEPT (has your MD download feature)

### Result:
- ✅ Working popup UI
- ✅ Working side panel
- ✅ Downloads BOTH .json AND .md files
