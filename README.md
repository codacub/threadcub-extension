# ThreadCub Chrome Extension (v1.0.5)

ThreadCub helps you stay in control of long AI conversations.

It adds a small floating button to supported AI chat sites so you can:
- **Save** a full conversation as a structured **JSON, Markdown, or PDF** file
- **Highlight + tag** key parts of a chat ("Pawmarks") with **anchors** and manage them in a side panel
- **Continue** a conversation into another AI platform by carrying context forward

> Local-first by default. No required login.

---

## What's included

### ✅ Core features
- **Multi-format conversation export**
  - **JSON** - Structured data with title, URL, platform, timestamp, and messages
  - **Markdown** - Clean, readable format for documentation
  - **PDF** - Professional export with ThreadCub branding
  - Export menu with three-dot dropdown for easy format selection
  
- **Pawmarks (highlight + tagging)**
  - Select text → tag it (Don't Forget / Backlog / Priority)
  - Create **anchors** for quick navigation to important sections
  - Highlights **persist across sessions** via Chrome storage + XPath range restoration
  - **Side panel** with separate tabs for Tags and Anchors
  - Copy tagged text to clipboard with one click
  - Jump-to-highlight functionality
  - Individual delete controls for tags and anchors

  - Opens the next platform and auto-fills the prompt
  - Auto-submit supported on some platforms (see below)

### 🔐 Authentication / accounts (optional)
ThreadCub does **not** use a full auth system in the extension popup.
It uses an **anonymous session ID** by default, and can optionally read an auth token
from a ThreadCub dashboard tab (if present) for account linking.

### 📊 Usage Analytics (v1.0.5+)
ThreadCub includes privacy-first analytics to help improve the extension:
- **What we track:** Feature usage (tags created, exports, continuations), platform detection, extension installs/updates
- **What we DON'T track:** Conversation content, personal information, or any identifiable data
- **How it works:** Anonymous tracking via Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol
- **Privacy:** All tracking uses anonymous client IDs with no personal data collection
